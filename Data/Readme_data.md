# Data sets
There are three data sets for RPSE:

* rec_data.mat : the freehand ultrasound data set from NTNU (Please refer to the github link: https://github.com/tboerstad/DSPView )
* rec_data_sonon_g.mat : the portable ultrasound data set from gelation phantom collected by U of Waterloo 
* rec_data_v_phantom_64act.mat: the numerical phantom data set generated from the FEA model and Field-II (made by me)
